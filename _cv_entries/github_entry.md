title: Under the Hood - Android App Debug View Library
description: Under the Hood is a flexible and powerful Android debug view library. It uses a modular template system 
  that can be easily extended to your needs, although coming with many useful elements built-in. There is a lot of 
  "default" debug data that can be easily embedded (e.g. current runtime-permission status, app version and device 
  info). There are 2 basic themes (dark and light) which can be customized to your needs. The lib is divided into 
  2 modules hood-core containing the basic view that can be embedded anywhere and hood-extended which comes with a 
  ready-to-use activity with a lot of convenience features. The lib has also a null-safe no-op flavor indented to be 
  used in release builds, disabling all debug features without error-prone if-debug chains.
